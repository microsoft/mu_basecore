/**
  Send NVM Express FormatNVM Admin Command

  The Format NVM command is used to low level format the NVM media. This command is used by
  the host to change the LBA data size and/or metadata size.

  A low level format may destroy all data and metadata associated with all namespaces or only
  the specific namespace associated with the command (refer to the Format NVM Attributes field
  in the Identify Controller data structure).

  After the Format NVM command successfully completes, the controller shall not return any user
  data that was previously contained in an affected namespace.

  @param[in] This            Indicates a pointer to the calling context (Block IO Protocol)
  @param[in] NamespaceId     The NVM Express namespace ID  for which a device path node is to be
                             allocated and built. Caller must set the NamespaceId to zero if the
                             device path node will contain a valid UUID.
  @param[in] Ses             Secure Erase Setting (SES) value
                               - 000b: No secure erase operation requested

  @param[in] Flbas           New LBA size (in terms of LBA Format size Index (bits 3:0) in NamespaceData).
                             If this param is 0 (NULL), then use existing LBA size.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The device formatted correctly.
  @retval EFI_WRITE_PROTECTED   The device can not be formatted due to write protection.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The device reported an error while performing the format.
  @retval EFI_NO_MEDIA          There is no media in the device.
  @retval EFI_MEDIA_CHNAGED     The MediaId does not matched the current device.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER The format request contains parameters that are not valid.

/**
  Send NVM Express Sanitize Admin Command

  The Sanitize command is used to start a sanitize operation or to recover from a previously
  failed sanitize operation. The sanitize operation types that may be supported are Block
  Erase, Crypto Erase, and Overwrite.

  All sanitize operations are processed in the background (i.e., completion of the Sanitize
  command does not indicate completion of the sanitize operation).

                                    device path node will contain a valid UUID.

  @param[in] NoDeallocAfterSanitize No deallocate after sanitize option
  @param[in] OverwritePattern       Pattern to overwrite old user data

  Clear Media utilizes transport native WRITE commands to write a fixed pattern
