## @file
#  Since the C compiler does very aggressive full program optimizations there are cases
#  where some small number of compiler inserted functions can not be avoided.  
#  To handle that case this NULL library can be injected into all 32bit modules
#  so that the link time dependency is met and the modules compile.  
#  
#  The routines are based on src delivered with the visual studio product.  it is 
#  critical that calling convention, stack usage, register usage, etc is in line 
#  with what the compiler expects as there is no way to influence the behaviors
#  for compiler inserted functions.
