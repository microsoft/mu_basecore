## What

TianoCore/Project Mu Edk2 Build tools

## Version

BaseTools binaries are versioned based on the Release branch they are associated
with (e.g. release/201808, release/201811, etc.). The version format is
YYYY.MM.XX where:

* YYYY is the 4-digit year
* MM is the 2-digit month
* XX is a point-release in case fixes are required

Nuget version is AA.BB.CC

* If the version is a single number then make it the _AA_ field and use zeros
  for _BB.CC_
  * Example:  version command is **20160912**  then NuGet version is
    **20160912.0.0**
* If a version has two numbers partitioned by a "-" then make those the _AA.BB_
  fields and use zero for the _CC_
  * Example: version command is **1234-56** then NuGet version is **1234.56.0**

## Process to publish new version of tool

1. Download desired version from
2. Unzip
3. Make a new folder (for my example I will call it "new")
4. Make proper subfolders for each host. (Details in NugetPublishing/ReadMe.md)
5. Copy the assets to publish into this new folder
6. Run the <_TOOL_> -v command to see the version.
7. Open cmd prompt in the NugetPublishing dir
8. Pack and push

  ```cmd
  NugetPublishing.py --Operation PackAndPush --ConfigFilePath Mu-Basetools.config.json --Version <nuget version here> --InputFolderPath <path to newly created folder here>  --ApiKey <your key here>
  ```
