/**
  The entry point of PE/COFF Image for the STANDALONE MM Core.

  This function is the entry point for the STANDALONE MM Core. This function is required to call
  ProcessModuleEntryPointList() and ProcessModuleEntryPointList() is never expected to return.
  The STANDALONE MM Core is responsible for calling ProcessLibraryConstructorList() as soon as the EFI
  System Table and the image handle for the STANDALONE MM Core itself have been established.
  If ProcessModuleEntryPointList() returns, then ASSERT() and halt the system.
