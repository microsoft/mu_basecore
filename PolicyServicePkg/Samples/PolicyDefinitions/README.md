This directory contains sample policy definitions using YAML files to demonstrate a basic use of
the policy autogen output. The [GFX header file](PolicyDataStructGFX.h) demonstrates all the
structures, templates and interfaces generated.

The functions are directly invocable from firmware code and template can be used verified policy operations.
