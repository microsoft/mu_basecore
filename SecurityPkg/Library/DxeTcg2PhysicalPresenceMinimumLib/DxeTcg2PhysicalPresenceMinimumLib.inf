# This is not a true override, but as this is derived from the full-featured lib, we want to track if any bugs are fixed there to ensure they are fixed here
# A minimized version of the TCG2 Physical Presence Library that implements only the features that are required by the TCG PPI 1.3 spec,
# optional features are removed, the only supported function is to Clear the TPM, and is always approved with no UX
