/**
  Provide verification service for signed images, which include both signature validation
  and platform policy control. For signature types, both UEFI WIN_CERTIFICATE_UEFI_GUID and
  MSFT Authenticode type signatures are supported.

  In this implementation, only verify external executables when in USER MODE.
  Executables from FV is bypass, so pass in AuthenticationStatus is ignored.

  The image verification policy is:
    If the image is signed,
      At least one valid signature or at least one hash value of the image must match a record
      in the security database "db", and no valid signature nor any hash value of the image may
      be reflected in the security database "dbx".
    Otherwise, the image is not signed,
      The hash value of the image must match a record in the security database "db", and
      not be reflected in the security data base "dbx".

  Caution: This function may receive untrusted input.
  PE/COFF image is external input, so this function will validate its data structure
  within this image buffer before use.

  @param[in]    AuthenticationStatus
                           This is the authentication status returned from the security
                           measurement services for the input file.
  @param[in]    File       This is a pointer to the device path of the file that is
                           being dispatched. This will optionally be used for logging.
  @param[in]    FileBuffer File buffer matches the input file device path.
  @param[in]    FileSize   Size of File buffer matches the input file device path.
  @param[in]    BootPolicy A boot policy that was used to call LoadImage() UEFI service.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The file specified by DevicePath and non-NULL
                                 FileBuffer did authenticate, and the platform policy dictates
                                 that the DXE Foundation may use the file.
  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The device path specified by NULL device path DevicePath
                                 and non-NULL FileBuffer did authenticate, and the platform
                                 policy dictates that the DXE Foundation may execute the image in
                                 FileBuffer.
  @retval EFI_ACCESS_DENIED      The file specified by File and FileBuffer did not
                                 authenticate, and the DXE Foundation may not use File. The
                                 image has been added to the file execution table.
