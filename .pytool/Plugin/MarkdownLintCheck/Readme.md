# Markdown Lint Plugin

This CiBuildPlugin scans all the markdown files in a given package and
checks for linter errors.

## Requirements

The test case in this plugin will be skipped if the requirements are not met.

1. NodeJs installed and on your path
2. `markdownlint-cli` NodeJs package installed
3. a `.markdownlint.yaml` config file either at your repository root or package root.

* NodeJS: <https://nodejs.org/en/>
* markdownlint-cli: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdownlint-cli>
  * Src available:  <https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli>

## Configuration

It is desired to use standard configuration methods so that both local editors (vscode, etc)
and the CI process leverage the same configuration.  This mostly works but for ignoring
files there is currently a small discrepancy.

First there is/can be a `.markdownlintignore` file at root of the repository.  This
file much like a `.gitignore` is great for broadly ignoring files with patterns.  This
works for both editor/ci.

But for package based ignores and to keep the control of which files to ignore within the package
there is no answer that supports both CI and editors.  Open question here

For the CI plugin you can use the IgnoreFiles configuration option described in the Plugin Configuration.

## Plugin Configuration

The plugin has only minimal configuration options to support the UEFI codebase.

``` yaml
  "MarkdownLintCheck": {
    "AuditOnly": False,          # If True, log all errors and then mark as skipped
    "IgnoreFiles": []            # package root relative file, folder, or glob pattern to ignore
  }
```

### AuditOnly

Boolean - Default is False.
If True run the test in an Audit only mode which will log all errors but instead
of failing the build it will set the test as skipped.  This allows visibility
into the failures without breaking the build.

### IgnoreFiles

This supports package relative files, folders, and glob patterns to ignore.
These are passed to the markdownlint-cli tool as quoted -i parameters.

## Linter Configuration

All configuration options available to the linter can be set in the  `.markdownlint.yaml`.
This includes customizing rule options and enforcement.
See more details here: <https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#configuration>
Linter Rules are described here: <https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md>

## Rule Overrides

There are times when a certain rule should not apply to part of a markdown file.
Markdownlint has numerous ways to configure this.
See the in file Configuration options described at the links above
