# Downloads the CodeQL Command-Line Interface (CLI) application that support Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
#
# This download is very large but conveniently provides support for all operating systems. Use it if you
# need CodeQL CLI support without concern for the host operating system.
#
# In an environment where a platform might build in different operating systems, it is recommended to set
# the scope for the appropriate CodeQL external dependency based on the host operating system being used.
