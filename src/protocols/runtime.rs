/// Allows the runtime functionality of the DXE Foundation to be contained
/// in a separate driver. It also provides hooks for the DXE Foundation to
/// export information that is needed at runtime. As such, this protocol allows
/// services to the DXE Foundation to manage runtime drivers and events.
/// This protocol also implies that the runtime services required to transition
/// to virtual mode, SetVirtualAddressMap() and ConvertPointer(), have been
/// registered into the UEFI Runtime Table in the UEFI System Table. This protocol
/// must be produced by a runtime DXE driver and may only be consumed by the DXE Foundation.
